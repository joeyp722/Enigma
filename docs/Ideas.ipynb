    "* Add documentation.\n",
    "* Iteratively clean up code and documentation.\n",
    "* One of the faster classical SAT solver algorithms solves 3-SAT problems with a time-complexity that scales as O((4/3)^n) for n literals [2], which is indeed faster for 3-SAT problems. The reason for this is that it takes advantage of the structure in the CNF. However, according to the paper the time-complexity, O((2(k-1)/k)^n), gets worse when the value of k gets larger. Here k refers to the k in k-SAT. Because Grover's algorithm [1] has a time-complexity of O(sqrt(2^n)) it might be faster for larger values of k. Also consider that k-SAT can be converted to 3-SAT, this however usually introduces more literals, thus is not necessarily faster. All this seems to indicate some threshold of k that separates the advantages of this classical algorithm and Grover's algorithm. The paper assumes the CNF has one solution.    \n",
    "* Also want to see if symmetries lead to a more favorable time-complexity, since symmetries could give rise to multiple solutions. Because in some cases different solutions could arise from symmetric transformations. For example a literal permutation between x0 and x1 gives one extra solution for 0100 that is 1000, where x0 x1 x2 x3. But not for 1100, since it remains the same, being 1100.\n",
    "* Just as classical NP-Complete problems exist quantum QMA-Complete problems also exist, one example of these problems is finding the ground state for a k-local Hamiltonian [3].\n",
    "* Is it possible to build a verifier that performs a bit-flip when the correct state is found, while the ancilla remains unchanged for an incorrect state? If a superposition of correct and incorrect states in fed into the verifier will the following entanglement happen: |\"Incorrect states\">|0>+|\"Correct states\">|1> ? One might choose such a superposition in the beginning. However, if one measures the ancilla state |1>, then the superposition automatically collapses to the \"Correct\" state.\n",
    "* A drawback of the method above might be that the probability of measuring the |1> state might be very low. This probability might be increased by applying Grover's algorithm before verification.\n",
    "* The same verifier might be used as an Oracle by performing a phase-flip instead of a bit-flip.\n",
    "* Normally the eigenstates of an Oracle are in the Z-basis. In beginning the Hadamard transformation is used to transform the vacuum state to a superposition of all the relevant eigenstates. From now on a transformation from the vacuum state to a superposition of eigenstates is defined by the transformation M : |\"vacuum\"> -> |s>.\n",
    "* In the case of the diffuser the inverse transformation of M is performed first, then the vacuum state receives a phase-flip, and finally the transformation M is applied again.\n",
    "* However, a verifier Oracle might have different eigenstates, thus could also use a different transformation. If M: |\"vacuum\"> -> |s>, then |s> must contain at least one the \"Correct\" states, since it is one of the relevant eigenstates we where looking for.\n",
    "* To build a verifier that can verify if the eigenenergy of an eigenstate is below a certain value the phase estimation algorithm might be used.\n",
    "* By measuring the qubit that represents the divide between the upper and lower part of the range first. It can decided if the energy is in the upper or lower part of the range. The upper and lower parts can again be divided into their own upper and lower parts (quadrants), this is represented by the output second qubit. Thus, by running the algorithm once one can decide in what half of the range the energy lies. By running the algorithm again but by measuring the second output qubit instead, one can decide in what quadrant the energy lies. So by induction it performs like a binary search.\n",
    "* In order to combine multiple constraints one might use quantum AND and OR gates. The input qubits for these gates are the output qubits of the verifiers.\n",
    "* The effect of different verifiers might also be compared with each other. When a extra qubit is introduced to activate verifier 1 when in the |0> state and verifier 2 when in the |1> state the quadratic speed up provided by Grover's algorithm might be utilized, since the introduced qubit is part of the Hilbert space which the Oracle acts on. Note that more verifiers might be added as well. However, they all must use the same transformation M. Thus, this feature might be used to compare Hamiltonian's that have minor differences among them.\n",
    "* Can all the Propositions above, that utilize Grover's algorithm, also be performed by the Quantum amplitude amplification [4] algorithm?"
