# Grover SAT solver
The aim of this project is to build a quantum algorithm that can solve SAT problems. SAT refers to satisfiability of a Boolean formula, meaning that there exists a input where the output of the formula is TRUE.

Grover refers to Grover's algorithm from quantum computing [1]. This algorithm uses an oracle to find the states it is looking for, hence the oracle must be representative of the Boolean formula to find a matching input.

## Documentation

Documentation can be found in the docs directory, that contains documentation on:

* Prerequisites
* Introduction to SAT
* Grover sat solver

## Oracle

In order for the oracle to work all the states of interest must receive a phase-flip, meaning that the coefficient in the state vector is multiplied with -1.

The oracle is always succeeded by a diffuser. This part of the algorithm can be repeated multiple times depending on the number of iterations.

In order to construct an oracle for a cnf. All the clauses have their own ancilla qubit on which a bit-flip is performed if the clause is TRUE. If a clauses are true then a phase-flip is performed via a quantum AND gate, again via a new ancillary qubit that provides a phase kickback.

Note that the bit-flips on the ancilla qubits have to be undone, thus the gates responsible for this are performed once more.

To gain a better understanding I would suggest looking at:

> cnf_oracle.py

Or it's subroutine counterpart:

> enigma.quantum_gates.cnf_oracle

## Further remarks

I hope the idea became clear even though the documentation is perhaps rather primitive. The two main take away points are:

* The oracle works via phase kickback from ancilla qubits.
* Not knowing how many solutions there are doesn't matter for the time complexity. It is still O( sqrt(N/k) )

The heart of the algorithm lies in the functions:

* enigma.quantum_gates.cnf_oracle
* enigma.quantum_algorithms.grover_sat_solver

## Future plans

More long term plans:

* Add documentation.
* Iteratively clean up code and documentation.
* One of the faster classical SAT solver algorithms solves 3-SAT problems with a time-complexity that scales as O((4/3)^n) for n literals [2], which is indeed faster for 3-SAT problems. The reason for this is that it takes advantage of the structure in the CNF. However, according to the paper the time-complexity, O((2(k-1)/k)^n), gets worse when the value of k gets larger. Here k refers to the k in k-SAT. Because Grover's algorithm has a time-complexity of O(sqrt(2^n)) it might be faster for larger values of k. Also consider that k-SAT can be converted to 3-SAT, this however usually introduces more literals, thus is not necessarily faster. All this seems to indicate some threshold of k that separates the advantages of classical and quantum algorithms. The paper assumes the CNF has one solution.    
* Also want to see if symmetries lead to a more favorable time-complexity, since symmetries could give rise to multiple solutions. Because in some cases different solutions could arise from symmetric transformations. For example a literal permutation between x0 and x1 gives one extra solution for 0100 that is 1000, where x0 x1 x2 x3. But not for 1100, since it remains the same, being 1100.
